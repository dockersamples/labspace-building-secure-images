# Introduction

👋 Welcome to this Labspace focused on helping you build secure container images. 

By the end, you will have learned the following:

- Using Docker Scout to perform an analysis of a container image
- Selecting base images for a more secure foundation
- Resolving application-level CVEs
- Configuring a default non-root user



> [!IMPORTANT]
> While this Labspace is using a Node-based application, the principles apply universally to all image builds. Therefore, don't put too much focus on the Node-specific elements.

With that, let's dive in and get to it!
